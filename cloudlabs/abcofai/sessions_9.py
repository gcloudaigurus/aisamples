#This program doesn't directly address the *full* scope of "AI Ethics and the Future of AI," as that's a vast and complex topic requiring extensive research and philosophical discussion.  However, it demonstrates a small, runnable example related to a specific ethical concern: **bias in AI**.  It shows how bias in training data can lead to biased AI outputs.

#This program uses a simplified example for demonstration. Real-world bias detection and mitigation are far more complex and require advanced techniques.

#This program highlights how biased training data (more positive reviews for male-coded names) can lead to a biased AI model.  The "mitigation" section is extremely basic and only serves to illustrate that the problem exists and requires advanced solutions.  Real-world bias mitigation involves techniques like data augmentation, adversarial training, and careful selection of features and algorithms.  The ethical considerations extend far beyond this simple example.  To truly explore "AI Ethics and the Future of AI," research topics like fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy in AI systems is necessary.
