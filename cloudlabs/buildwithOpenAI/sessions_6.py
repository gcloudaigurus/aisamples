
# This program demonstrates a simplified example of fine-tuning a language model.  
# Due to resource constraints, a real fine-tuning process with a large language model 
# requires significant computational power and specialized libraries like transformers.
# This example uses a smaller, simpler model and simulates the process.

# We'll simulate a language model using a dictionary.  In reality, this would be a large neural network.
model = {
    "The quick brown fox": ["jumps", "runs", "walks"],
    "The lazy dog": ["sleeps", "eats", "barks"],
    "The cat": ["meows", "purrs", "sleeps"]
}

# Our "training data" - a set of sentences and desired next words.
training_data = [
    ("The quick brown fox", "jumps over the lazy dog"),
    ("The lazy dog", "sleeps soundly"),
    ("The cat", "meows loudly")
]

# Simulate fine-tuning: We'll adjust the model's predictions based on the training data.
# This is a highly simplified representation of backpropagation and gradient descent.
def fine_tune(model, training_data):
    for sentence, next_word in training_data:

            if next_word not in model[sentence]:
                model[sentence].append(next_word)  # Add new word to predictions
            else:
                # Simulate increasing the probability of the correct next word
                model[sentence].insert(0, next_word) #Move to the front of the list


# Fine-tune the model

#  In a real-world scenario:
#  1. You'd load a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) using libraries like transformers.
#  2. You'd prepare your training data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
#  3. You'd use an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy) to train the model.
#  4. You'd use a GPU for faster training.
#  5. The training process would involve iterating over the training data multiple times, adjusting the model's weights to minimize the loss.
#  6. You'd evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to avoid overfitting.
