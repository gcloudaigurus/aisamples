# Trend 1:  Improved Efficiency and Reduced Computational Costs
#  Research focuses on making LLMs faster and cheaper to train and run.  Quantization and pruning are key techniques.

    max_val = np.max(weights)

weights = np.random.rand(10, 10) # Example weights
quantized_weights = quantize_weights(weights)

#print("Original weights:\n", weights)
#print("Quantized weights:\n", quantized_weights)


# Trend 2:  Improved Reasoning and Few-Shot Learning
# Research aims to enable LLMs to perform complex reasoning tasks with minimal examples.  This often involves techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.

def chain_of_thought_prompting(prompt, examples):
    """Simulates chain-of-thought prompting to improve reasoning abilities."""
    # This is a highly simplified representation.  Actual implementation would be far more complex.
    #  It would likely involve a large language model itself to generate the reasoning steps.

        reasoning = "Based on the examples, " + prompt + "..." #Rudimentary chain of thought
    else:
        reasoning = prompt + "..."

prompt = "What is 2 + 2 * 3?"
examples = [("What is 1 + 1 * 2?", "1 + 1 * 2 = 3"), ("What is 3 + 4 * 2?", "3 + 4 * 2 = 11")]
reasoning = chain_of_thought_prompting(prompt, examples)
#print(reasoning) # Output will be a very simple simulation


# Trend 3:  Multimodal LLMs
#  Research explores combining language models with other modalities like images, audio, and video.

# This section would require external libraries for image/audio processing, which are omitted for simplicity.  
# A real implementation would involve complex data loading and model architectures.

# Example (Conceptual):
# image = load_image("myimage.jpg") # Placeholder for image loading
# audio = load_audio("mysound.wav") # Placeholder for audio loading
# multimodal_llm_output = process_multimodal_input(image, audio, "Describe the scene.") # Placeholder for a multimodal LLM


# Trend 4:  Explainability and Interpretability
# Research focuses on understanding *why* LLMs produce certain outputs, enhancing trust and debugging.

# This is a very complex area, with no simple solution.  Research is ongoing.
#  Example (Conceptual):  Techniques like attention visualization could be used to show which parts of the input influenced the output.



# Trend 5:  Addressing Biases and Ethical Concerns
# Research investigates methods to mitigate biases in LLMs and ensure responsible use.

# This area involves sophisticated techniques in data preprocessing, model training, and post-processing.  It's an ongoing and critical research area.


# NOTE: This is a highly simplified illustration.  Real-world research in these areas is far more complex, involving extensive datasets, specialized hardware, and advanced algorithms.
