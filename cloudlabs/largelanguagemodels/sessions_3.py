
# This program demonstrates a simplified example of training and fine-tuning a language model. 
# Due to the resource intensity of training LLMs, this example uses a small dataset and a simplified model.
#  A real-world application would require significantly more data, computational power, and a more sophisticated model architecture.

# We will use the transformers library for ease of use.  Install it with: pip install transformers datasets

# Define the model and tokenizer. We'll use a small, readily available model for this example.
model_name = "gpt2" # Consider a smaller model for quicker experimentation.  Larger models require more resources.
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)


# Load a small dataset. Replace this with your own dataset. This is a placeholder.
#  Real datasets would likely be much larger and require more preprocessing.
dataset = load_dataset('csv', data_files={'train': 'data.csv'}) # data.csv needs to be created with columns 'text'

# Preprocess the data.  This is a very basic example, real-world preprocessing is more complex.
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)


# Define training arguments. Adjust these based on your resources and needs.

# Create the Trainer and train the model.

    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],

# Save the fine-tuned model.
trainer.save_model("./fine_tuned_model")

# Example of how to use the fine-tuned model for generation (after training).
prompt = "This is a test sentence."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(input_ids)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(f"Generated text: {generated_text}")


# IMPORTANT:  This is a highly simplified example.  Real-world LLM training requires:
# - Much larger datasets (potentially millions or billions of tokens)
# - More powerful hardware (multiple GPUs or TPUs)
# - Advanced techniques like gradient accumulation, mixed precision training, and more sophisticated optimizers.
# - Careful hyperparameter tuning
# - Robust evaluation metrics
# - Thorough consideration of ethical implications.

#To run this, create a file named `data.csv` with a column named "text" containing your training data.  Example:
#text
#This is an example sentence.
#Another sentence for training.
#More training data here.
