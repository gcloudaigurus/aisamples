
# LLM Applications: Text Generation - Sample Program

# This program demonstrates text generation using a pre-trained language model.  
# We'll use the transformers library, which provides easy access to many powerful models.
# Note: You'll need to install the transformers library: `pip install transformers`

from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the text generation pipeline.  
# We're using a small, fast model for demonstration.  Larger models will generate more coherent and creative text, 
# but require more computational resources and may take longer.
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2') #You can experiment with different models here like 'distilgpt2' or others from huggingface.co/models

# Define the prompt or input text.  The model will generate text based on this prompt.
prompt = "Once upon a time, in a land far away,"

# Generate text.  The `max_length` parameter controls the length of the generated text.
# `num_return_sequences` specifies the number of different texts to generate from the same prompt.
# `temperature` controls the randomness of the generated text. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) result in more creative but potentially less coherent text.
generated_text = generator(prompt, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=3, temperature=0.7)

# Print the generated text.
for text in generated_text:
    print(text['generated_text'])

#Further improvements could include:
# 1. Using a larger, more powerful model for better quality text.
# 2. Fine-tuning a model on a specific dataset for more customized text generation.
# 3. Implementing more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques to control the generated text more precisely.
# 4. Adding error handling to gracefully manage potential issues (e.g., network errors, model loading failures).
# 5. Integrating with a user interface for a more interactive experience.
