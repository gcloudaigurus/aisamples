
# Sample Python program demonstrating prompt engineering and effective LLM interaction.  This example uses a simple simulated LLM for demonstration purposes.  A real LLM (like OpenAI's GPT-3, etc.) would require an API key and library.

# Simulate an LLM response â€“ replace this with a real LLM call in a production environment.
def simulate_llm_response(prompt):
    # This is a rudimentary example; a real LLM would provide far richer and more nuanced responses.

        return "A brief summary of the provided text." #Needs improvement, should actually summarize.
    else:
        return "I don't understand your request."

def get_llm_response(user_input):
    # 1. Clarification:  Ensure the prompt is unambiguous and specific.
    refined_prompt = f"Please provide a concise {user_input}"  #Adding structure for better response

    #2. Context:  Provide relevant background information if necessary. (Not shown in this simple example, but crucial for complex tasks)

    # 3. Constraints: Specify desired format (e.g., JSON, bullet points) or length. (Illustrative)
    if "summary" in user_input.lower():
        refined_prompt += " in bullet points."

    # 4. Examples: Giving examples improves the LLM's understanding of your expectations. (Not demonstrated here for brevity).

    # 5. Iterative refinement: if initial response is unsatisfactory, modify the prompt and re-query. (Not implemented for simplicity).
