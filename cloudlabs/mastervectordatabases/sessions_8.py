
# This example demonstrates a simple, scalable web application using Flask and Gunicorn.
# It's not a full-fledged deployment solution, but it showcases key concepts.

# For a real-world deployment, consider using Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample endpoint
@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    # Simulate some data processing or database interaction.  In a real application,
    # this would be replaced with more complex logic.
    data = {'message': 'Hello from a scalable application!'}
    return jsonify(data)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # This runs the Flask app directly, suitable for development.
    # For deployment, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
    app.run(debug=True) #debug mode should be off in production

# To run with Gunicorn (for deployment):
# 1. Install Gunicorn:  pip install gunicorn
# 2. Run the server: gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app  
#    --workers 3 specifies 3 worker processes for handling requests concurrently. Adjust as needed.
#    --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 makes the server listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 5000.

# Scalability:
#  - Gunicorn's worker processes allow handling multiple requests simultaneously.
#  - More workers increase concurrency (handling more requests at the same time).
#  - Load balancers can distribute traffic across multiple Gunicorn instances (or other servers) for even greater scalability.
#  - Cloud platforms offer automatic scaling based on demand.


#Further improvements for production:
# * Add error handling
# * Implement proper logging
# * Use a database for persistent data
# * Consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx for improved performance and security
# * Implement monitoring and alerting
# * Secure your application (HTTPS, authentication, authorization)
# * Test thoroughly before deploying to production
