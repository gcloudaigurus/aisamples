
# Handling Ambiguity and Bias in Prompts: A Sample Python Program

# This program demonstrates how to mitigate ambiguity and bias in prompts 
# by providing clear instructions, diverse examples, and considering potential biases.

# Ambiguity Example:  The prompt "Write about dogs" is ambiguous.  
# What kind of dogs? What aspects should be discussed?

# Bias Example: A prompt like "Describe a typical doctor" might implicitly 
# bias the response towards a specific gender or race, reflecting societal stereotypes.


def generate_text(prompt, examples=None, constraints=None):
    """
    Generates text based on a prompt, mitigating ambiguity and bias.

    Args:
        prompt: The main prompt (string).
        examples: A list of example text completions (list of strings), to reduce ambiguity and guide style.
        constraints: A dictionary of constraints to reduce bias (e.g., {"gender": ["male", "female"], "race": ["white", "black", "asian"]}).  This feature is rudimentary and needs more sophisticated handling in real-world scenarios.


    Returns:
        A string containing the generated text.  (In a real application, this would likely use a language model)
